      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring developer in his early 30's.  After years of working my butt off in property maintenance, i decided to make a serious life and career change.  That change has brought me to development and the tech world in general.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I claim Texas but i grew up 20 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I really enjoy video games, mainly open world Rpgs, i also have been told im a great singer.  I love to play guitar and sing songs.  Other then that i love spending time with my girlfriend and our pets</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Probably game development, but really anything that allows me to apply my nerdiness, creativity and tech skills into a way to sustain a comfortable happy life with my family</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in San Antonio Texas, but we just bought a house in Seguin Texas and we move in November!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Ive always had a knack for computers, music, editing, art etc.  Ive had a lack of passion doing maintenance work and i have always felt that i would be contributing more if i got into something that would allow me to use my brain more.  I learn very quickly and technology and pc's in particular have always played a big role in my life.  Therefore i figured it was time to make a change and dive into something new and exciting that has great growth potential and endless knowledge to gain</p>
